# Intelligent Data Analyst Agent (MCP-Based)

## Objective

Design an intelligent, modular, data-agnostic agent capable of processing diverse traffic-related data using a dynamic suite of up to 100 MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools. The system supports high-throughput workloads, tool chaining, visualization, and secure API-based integration into larger architectures.

---

## ðŸ§± Core Components

### 1. Agent API Layer
**Tech:** Python (FastAPI/Flask), Docker  
**Purpose:** Exposes REST endpoints (e.g., `/analyze`) to accept input data and context

**Responsibilities:**
- Parse & validate request payloads
- Forward to Router for tool assignment
- Manage response formatting, chaining, and error handling
- Emit job/run events for visualization dashboards

### 2. Router Module
**Modes:**
- Rule-Based Routing: Based on input types, keywords, metadata
- ML-Based Routing: Intent classification using ML/LLM
- Hybrid Routing: Fast rules + fallback to model-driven dispatch

**Responsibilities:**
- Decide best-fit MCP tool or tool chain
- Send routing metadata to Dispatcher
- Generate trace identifiers and step metadata for visualization

### 3. Tool Dispatcher
**Function:** Orchestrates tool invocations

**Protocols Supported:**
- REST (default)
- gRPC (for low-latency/high-throughput)
- Kafka/RabbitMQ (for async workloads)

**Responsibilities:**
- Handles retries, timeouts
- Resolves tool endpoint from Tool Registry
- Loads authentication headers + payloads
- Publishes step progress and results for visualization and tracing

### 4. Tool Chaining Manager
**Purpose:** Executes tool pipelines

**Approach:**
- DAG-based chaining (e.g., Anomaly Detection -> Clustering)
- Agent-guided dynamic chaining

**Responsibilities:**
- Manage data hand-off between tools
- Track intermediate results and state
- Report stage transitions to the visualization subsystem

### 5. Tool Registry
**Storage:** Local JSON file or database

**Fields:**
- Tool name, task type, supported data types
- Endpoint URL & communication protocol
- Version, metadata, health status
- Visualization metadata: category, icon, color code, owner

### 6. MCP Tool Interface
**Standardized Schema:**
```json
{
	"input": { ... },
	"context": { ... }
}
```
**Returns:**
```json
{
	"status": "success",
	"output": { ... },
	"meta": { ... }
}
```

*This architecture enables scalable, flexible, and intelligent data analysis for diverse and demanding workloads.*

## Visualization & Monitoring Layer

**Purpose:** Provide full transparency into running processes and tool interactions.

**Components:**
- **Run Service / Jobs API:** Tracks all runs, jobs, steps, and statuses; exposes REST + WebSocket endpoints (e.g., `/v1/runs`, `/ws/runs/{id}`)
- **Dashboard UI:** Shows tool catalog, live runs, DAG visualizer (tool chaining), job progress, and metrics
- **Tracing:** OpenTelemetry + Jaeger/Tempo for distributed traces
- **Logs:** ELK/OpenSearch for structured logs (linked to runs)
- **Metrics:** Prometheus + Grafana for latency, throughput, error rate
- **Lineage:** OpenLineage/Marquez integration for datasetâ€“toolâ€“output provenance

**User View:**
- Tool catalog with capabilities, schema, and status
- Real-time run status, progress bars, ETA, per-step logs, and trace links
- DAG view showing current pipeline execution flow

---

## Communication & Throughput Management

**Options:**
- REST (development, small-scale)
- gRPC (binary RPCs, high throughput)
- Kafka (buffered, async tasks)

**Concurrency:**
- Python asyncio / Celery for parallel calls
- K8s for container auto-scaling
- KEDA for queue-based scaling

---

## Security Layer

**Auth:**
- JWT-based access control
- HMAC signing for internal tool calls

**Transport:**
- TLS encryption for REST/gRPC
- Kafka: TLS + SASL

**Audit Logging:**
- Request, tool, user, timestamp, result status
- Integrated into visualization UI for admin access

---

## Observability & Governance

**Tracing:** OpenTelemetry spans per request and tool
**Metrics:** Prometheus collectors for latency, throughput, queue lag
**Logging:** Structured, tenant-aware JSON logs
**SLOs & Alerts:** Alertmanager for anomalies and health checks

**Governance:**
- Versioning, tool lifecycle tracking
- Canary releases and shadow runs
- UI displays deprecation notices and tool change logs

---

## ðŸ—ƒ Data & Task Support

**Input Types:**
- Tabular (CSV, Excel, SQL result)
- Text (incident reports, logs)
- JSON/XML (API or IoT device input)
- Images (traffic cams)
- Geo (GeoJSON, GPS points)

**Supported Tasks:**
- Anomaly Detection
- Incident Detection
- Time-Series Forecasting
- Descriptive Stats & Comparison
- Classification / Regression
- Clustering & Feature Engineering
- Geospatial Mapping & Analysis

---

## Deployment Notes

- Containerized with Docker for each tool and core module
- Use Docker Compose or Kubernetes for orchestration
- Includes visualization stack (Grafana, Jaeger, ELK) and UI dashboard
- Designed to plug into larger systems as a callable API service
- Future-proofed for more advanced ML planning agents (e.g., LLM planner)

## Next Steps

1. Scaffold base API + agent logic
2. Implement router (rule-based first)
3. Add 3â€“5 MCP tools with REST endpoints
4. Integrate Run Service + WebSocket for real-time progress
5. Add UI layer for visualization (DAG, runs, logs)
6. Package with Docker Compose for local testing
7. Extend with gRPC + Kafka for async cases
